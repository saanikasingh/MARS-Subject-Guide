	{Application of composite materials used in the aerospace industry. Characteristics of composite materials; Analysis of the stiffness & strength behaviour of fibre-reinforced composite & sandwich structures; Composite materials manufacturing processes & techniques used in the aerospace industry. The course provides an introduction to composite materials, manufacturing and design with a primary focus on applications in the aerospace industry. Students will gain insight into the commonly used constituent materials, intermediates, and resulting composites and understand the many choices available in this hierarchy. The course will then introduce the students to the most common composite manufacturing processes for both thermoplastic and thermosetting matrix composites. Emphasis is put on enabling students to select the most appropriate manufacturing process for a given application and material combination. The design component of the course covers the key concepts of structural design and evaluation of composite materials. This includes introducing students to micromechanics, classical-laminate theory, and failure theory of composite materials using both analytical as well as numerical methods. In the final two weeks of the semester, the course ventures into advanced topics, including sandwich structures, degradation and durability, and ceramic matrix composite materials and manufacturing. The learning experience is enhanced with two hands-on manufacturing practicals and a non-destructive testing workshop.}

Several key manufacturing techniques, such as nano-, electronic and sustainable manufacturing will be covered as case studies illuminating how materials and manufacturing processes affect the end performance of the product, the economics of production and the impact on society and the environment. To obtain greater insight into smart manufacturing processes, students will complete projects, literature reviews/lab reports and oral/poster presentations in specific areas of manufacturing.}

	{Materials Characterization provides unique tools for understanding the materials and their demonstrated properties. Materials Characterization techniques, such as x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, allow detailed structural, chemical, and morphological characteristics of materials to be determined, which has become essential tools for materials research and their productions. By corelating the determined structural and chemical characteristics of a material with its fabrication/processing, the formation mechanism of the material can be clarified. This is vital for developing new material systems, and for identifying problems in the production lines. On the other hand, the correlation of the determined structural and chemical characteristics of a material with its demonstrated properties allows the material's structure-property link to be built, which is critically important for understanding the origin of the properties. For this reason, demand for learning various materials characterization techniques have increased sharply in the recent decades.}

	{Additive Manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, is growing at a rapid rate, with global manufacturers increasingly realising the benefits of producing parts by AM. According to recent studies, the AM market has observed significant growth, with a projected compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.2% and a valuation of USD 13.89 billion in 2021. It is expected to reach $76.2 billion by 2030, representing a 20.9% CAGR (2022-2030). The AM industry's significant growth trajectory indicates a promising future, driven by its increasing adoption as a mainstream manufacturing process, which offers attractive advantages, including reduced production time and costs, and the ability to create complex designs with superior functionality. An example is newly optimised 3D printed metal aircraft brackets that are 50% lighter, use 90% less material and 90% less energy to produce compared to the equivalent bracket currently produced by machining. Given that AM will continue to grow, future engineers must adapt to this revolutionary manufacturing process, so now is a timely opportunity to introduce a dedicated course that prepares our graduates to work with this technology.}

	{Energy storage and conversion materials hold the key to many advanced renewable energy technologies including photo-voltaic systems, lithium-ion and next-generation batteries, hydrogen fuel cells and storage, and superconducting magnetic energy storage. With the increasing need for safe, cost-effective and environmentally friendly methods of energy storage and conversion, it is necessary to accelerate the rate at which energy-related materials are developed. Materials science is an essential enabling technology for emerging renewable technologies. Often, engineering solutions for the energy challenges facing society are constrained by the materials technologies available. This is especially true for energy storage and conversion materials. The aim of this course on Materials for Energy Conversion and Storage is to help future engineers create and develop new materials solutions to meet this global challenge.}

Solution techniques for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and non-linear equations are formulated and techniques for data fitting and optimisation (inc. least-squares approaches) are developed and applied to engineering problems. The final module of the course formulates computational techniques to solve partial differential equations (parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic) with numerous applications involving heat transfer, convection-diffusion, and wave propagation. Completion of this course will provide students with the necessary skills to develop computational approaches to address a wide range of engineering problems.}
